The input will be the related objects in the scene, nodes and edges in the current environment, and the desired node goals, edge goals, and action goals. The output should be action commands in json format so that after the robot executes the action commands sequentially, the ending environment would satisfy the goals. \n\nData format:\nObjects in the scene indicates those objects involved in the action execution. It follows the format: <object_name> (object_id)\n\nNodes and edges in the current environment shows the nodes' names, states and properties, and edges in the environment. \nNodes follow the format: object_name, states:... , properties:...\nEdges follow the format: object_name A is ... to object_name B\n \nNode goals show the target object states in the ending environment. They follow the format: object_name is ... (some state)\n\nEdge goals show the target relationships of objects in the ending environment. They follow the format: object_name A is ... (some relationship) to object_name B.\n\nAction goals specify the necessary actions you need to include in your predicted action commands sequence, and the order they appear in action goals should also be the RELATIVE order they appear in your predicted action commands sequence if there are more than one line. Each line in action goals include one action or more than one actions concatenated by OR. You only need to include ONE of the actions concatenated by OR in the same line. For example, if the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nGRAB\nTYPE or TOUCH\nOPEN\n------------------------\nThen your predicted action commands sequence should include GRAB, either TYPE or TOUCH, and OPEN. Besides, GRAB should be executed earlier than TYPE or TOUCH, and TYPE or TOUCH should be executed earlier than OPEN.\nIf the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nThere is no action requirement.\nIt means there is no action you have to include in output, and you can use any action to achieve the node and edge goals. Warning: No action requirement does not mean empty output. You should always output some actions and their arguments.\n\n\nAction commands include action name and objects. The number of objects (required_number of parameters) for each action is fixed and is given below, either 0, 1, or 2. The output action commands should be in json format. The dictionary keys should be action names. The dictionary values should be a list containing the objects of the corresponding action, where [] is for 0 object, [object] is for 1 object, [object 1, object 2] is for 2 objects. The action commands order is represented by the order they appear in the json dictionary. The key value pair appearing first will be executed first, the key value pair appearing second will be executed second, so on and so forth.\n\nFor example, if you want to first FIND the sink and then PUTBACK cup to the sink, you should express it as {'FIND':['sink'], 'PUTBACK':['cup', 'sink']}\n\nThe object of action also needs to satisfied some properties preconditions. For example, SWITCHON's object number is 1. To switch on something, the object should 'HAS_SWITCH'. The rule is represented as SWITCHON = (\"Switch on\", 1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]). Another example is POUR. POUR's object number is 2. To pour sth A into sth B, A should be pourable and drinkable, and B should be RECIPIENT.

For example, if the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nGRAB\nTYPE or TOUCH\nOPEN\n------------------------\nThen your predicted action commands sequence should include GRAB, either TYPE or TOUCH, and OPEN. Besides, GRAB should be executed earlier than TYPE or TOUCH, and TYPE or TOUCH should be executed earlier than OPEN.\nIf the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nThere is no action requirement.\nIt means there is no action you have to include in output, and you can use any action to achieve the node and edge goals. Warning: No action requirement does not mean empty output. You should always output some actions and their arguments.\n\n\nAction commands include action name and objects. The number of objects (required_number of parameters) for each action is fixed and is given below, either 0, 1, or 2. The output action commands should be in json format. The dictionary keys should be action names. The dictionary values should be a list containing the objects of the corresponding action, where [] is for 0 object, [object] is for 1 object, [object 1, object 2] is for 2 objects. The action commands order is represented by the order they appear in the json dictionary.

For example, SWITCHON's object number is 1. To switch on something, the object should 'HAS_SWITCH'. The rule is represented as SWITCHON = (\"Switch on\", 1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]). Another example is POUR. POUR's object number is 2. To pour sth A into sth B, A should be pourable and drinkable, and B should be RECIPIENT.

Besides, GRAB should be executed earlier than TYPE or TOUCH, and TYPE or TOUCH should be executed earlier than OPEN.\nIf the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nThere is no action requirement.\nIt means there is no action you have to include in output, and you can use any action to achieve the node and edge goals. Warning: No action requirement does not mean empty output. You should always output some actions and their arguments.\n\n\nAction commands include action name and objects. The number of objects (required_number of parameters) for each action is fixed and is given below, either 0, 1, or 2. The output action commands should be in json format. The dictionary keys should be action names. The dictionary values should be a list containing the objects of the corresponding action, where [] is for 0 object, [object] is for 1 object, [object 1, object 2] is for 2 objects. The action commands order is represented by the order they appear in the json dictionary. The key value pair appearing first will be executed first, the key value pair appearing second will be executed second, so on and so forth.\n\nFor example, if you want to first FIND the sink and then PUTBACK cup to the sink, you should express it as {'FIND':['sink'], 'PUTBACK':['cup', 'sink']}\n\nThe object of action also needs to satisfied some properties preconditions. For example, SWITCHON's object number is 1. To switch on something, the object should 'HAS_SWITCH'. The rule is represented as SWITCHON = (\"Switch on\", 1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]). Another example is POUR. POUR's object number is 2. To pour sth A into sth B, A should be pourable and drinkable, and B should be RECIPIENT. The rule is represented as POUR = (\"Pour\", 2, [['POURABLE', 'DRINKABLE'], ['RECIPIENT']]).\n\nAction Definitions Format:\nEach action is defined as a combination of:\nAction Name (String): A descriptive name for the action.\nRequired Number of Parameters (Integer): The count of parameters needed to perform the action.\nPreconditions for Each Object (List of Lists of Strings): Conditions that must be met for each object involved in the action.\n\nSupported Actions List:\nCLOSE: (1, [['CAN_OPEN']]) # Change state from OPEN to CLOSED\nDRINK: (1, [['DRINKABLE', 'RECIPIENT']]) # Consume a drinkable item\nFIND: (1, [[]]) # Locate and approach an item\nWALK: (1, [[]]) # Move towards something\nGRAB: (1, [['GRABBABLE']]) # Take hold of an item that can be grabbed\nLOOKAT: (1, [[]]) # Direct your gaze towards something\nOPEN: (1, [['CAN_OPEN']]) # Open an item that can be opened\nPOINTAT: (1, [[]]) # Point towards something\nPUTBACK: (2, [['GRABBABLE'], []]) # Place one object back onto or into another\nPUTIN: (2, [['GRABBABLE'], ['CAN_OPEN']]) # Insert one object into another\nRUN: (1, [[]]) # Run towards something\nSIT: (1, [['SITTABLE']]) # Sit on a suitable object\nSTANDUP: (0, []) # Stand up from a sitting or lying position\nSWITCHOFF: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Turn off an item with a switch\nSWITCHON: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Turn on an item with a switch\nTOUCH: (1, [[]]) # Physically touch something\nTURNTO: (1, [[]]) # Turn your body to face something\nWATCH: (1, [[]]) # Observe something attentively\nWIPE: (1, [[]]) # Clean or dry something by rubbing\nPUTON: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Dress oneself with an item of clothing\nPUTOFF: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Remove an item of clothing\nGREET: (1, [['PERSON']]) # Offer a greeting to a person\nDROP: (1, [[]]) # Let go of something so it falls\nREAD: (1, [['READABLE']]) # Read text from an object\nLIE: (1, [['LIEABLE']]) # Lay oneself down on an object\nPOUR: (2, [['POURABLE', 'DRINKABLE'], ['RECIPIENT']]) # Transfer a liquid from one container to another\nPUSH: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Exert force on something to move it away from you\nPULL: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Exert force on something to bring it towards you\nMOVE: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Change the location of an object\nWASH: (1, [[]]) # Clean something by immersing and agitating it in water\nRINSE: (1, [[]]) # Remove soap from something by applying water\nSCRUB: (1, [[]]) # Clean something by rubbing it hard with a brush\nSQUEEZE: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Compress clothes to extract liquid\nPLUGIN: (1, [['HAS_PLUG']]) # Connect an electrical device to a power source\nPLUGOUT: (1, [['HAS_PLUG']]) # Disconnect an electrical device from a power source\nCUT: (1, [['EATABLE', 'CUTABLE']]) # Cut some food\nEAT: (1, [['EATABLE']]) # Eat some food\nRELEASE: (1, [[]]) # Let go of something inside the current room\nTYPE: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Type on a keyboard\n\nNotice: \n1.

Besides, GRAB should be executed earlier than TYPE or TOUCH, and TYPE or TOUCH should be executed earlier than OPEN.\nIf the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nThere is no action requirement.\nIt means there is no action you have to include in output, and you can use any action to achieve the node and edge goals. Warning: No action requirement does not mean empty output. You should always output some actions and their arguments.\n\n\nAction commands include action name and objects. The number of objects (required_number of parameters) for each action is fixed and is given below, either 0, 1, or 2. The output action commands should be in json format. The dictionary keys should be action names. The dictionary values should be a list containing the objects of the corresponding action, where [] is for 0 object, [object] is for 1 object, [object 1, object 2] is for 2 objects. The action commands order is represented by the order they appear in the json dictionary. The key value pair appearing first will be executed first, the key value pair appearing second will be executed second, so on and so forth.\n\nFor example, if you want to first FIND the sink and then PUTBACK cup to the sink, you should express it as {'FIND':['sink'], 'PUTBACK':['cup', 'sink']}\n\nThe object of action also needs to satisfied some properties preconditions. For example, SWITCHON's object number is 1. To switch on something, the object should 'HAS_SWITCH'. The rule is represented as SWITCHON = (\"Switch on\", 1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]). Another example is POUR. POUR's object number is 2. To pour sth A into sth B, A should be pourable and drinkable, and B should be RECIPIENT.

Besides, GRAB should be executed earlier than TYPE or TOUCH, and TYPE or TOUCH should be executed earlier than OPEN.\nIf the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nThere is no action requirement.\nIt means there is no action you have to include in output, and you can use any action to achieve the node and edge goals. Warning: No action requirement does not mean empty output. You should always output some actions and their arguments.\n\n\nAction commands include action name and objects. The number of objects (required_number of parameters) for each action is fixed and is given below, either 0, 1, or 2. The output action commands should be in json format. The dictionary keys should be action names. The dictionary values should be a list containing the objects of the corresponding action, where [] is for 0 object, [object] is for 1 object, [object 1, object 2] is for 2 objects. The action commands order is represented by the order they appear in the json dictionary. The key value pair appearing first will be executed first, the key value pair appearing second will be executed second, so on and so forth.\n\nFor example, if you want to first FIND the sink and then PUTBACK cup to the sink, you should express it as {'FIND':['sink'], 'PUTBACK':['cup', 'sink']}\n\nThe object of action also needs to satisfied some properties preconditions. For example, SWITCHON's object number is 1. To switch on something, the object should 'HAS_SWITCH'. The rule is represented as SWITCHON = (\"Switch on\", 1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]). Another example is POUR. POUR's object number is 2. To pour sth A into sth B, A should be pourable and drinkable, and B should be RECIPIENT.

Besides, GRAB should be executed earlier than TYPE or TOUCH, and TYPE or TOUCH should be executed earlier than OPEN.\nIf the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nThere is no action requirement.\nIt means there is no action you have to include in output, and you can use any action to achieve the node and edge goals. Warning: No action requirement does not mean empty output. You should always output some actions and their arguments.\n\n\nAction commands include action name and objects. The number of objects (required_number of parameters) for each action is fixed and is given below, either 0, 1, or 2. The output action commands should be in json format. The dictionary keys should be action names. The dictionary values should be a list containing the objects of the corresponding action, where [] is for 0 object, [object] is for 1 object, [object 1, object 2] is for 2 objects. The action commands order is represented by the order they appear in the json dictionary. The key value pair appearing first will be executed first, the key value pair appearing second will be executed second, so on and so forth.\n\nFor example, if you want to first FIND the sink and then PUTBACK cup to the sink, you should express it as {'FIND':['sink'], 'PUTBACK':['cup', 'sink']}\n\nThe object of action also needs to satisfied some properties preconditions. For example, SWITCHON's object number is 1. To switch on something, the object should 'HAS_SWITCH'. The rule is represented as SWITCHON = (\"Switch on\", 1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]). Another example is POUR. POUR's object number is 2. To pour sth A into sth B, A should be pourable and drinkable, and B should be RECIPIENT. The rule is represented as POUR = (\"Pour\", 2, [['POURABLE', 'DRINKABLE'], ['RECIPIENT']]).\n\nAction Definitions Format:\nEach action is defined as a combination of:\nAction Name (String): A descriptive name for the action.\nRequired Number of Parameters (Integer): The count of parameters needed to perform the action.\nPreconditions for Each Object (List of Lists of Strings): Conditions that must be met for each object involved in the action.\n\nSupported Actions List:\nCLOSE: (1, [['CAN_OPEN']]) # Change state from OPEN to CLOSED\nDRINK: (1, [['DRINKABLE', 'RECIPIENT']]) # Consume a drinkable item\nFIND: (1, [[]]) # Locate and approach an item\nWALK: (1, [[]]) # Move towards something\nGRAB: (1, [['GRABBABLE']]) # Take hold of an item that can be grabbed\nLOOKAT: (1, [[]]) # Direct your gaze towards something\nOPEN: (1, [['CAN_OPEN']]) # Open an item that can be opened\nPOINTAT: (1, [[]]) # Point towards something\nPUTBACK: (2, [['GRABBABLE'], []]) # Place one object back onto or into another\nPUTIN: (2, [['GRABBABLE'], ['CAN_OPEN']]) # Insert one object into another\nRUN: (1, [[]]) # Run towards something\nSIT: (1, [['SITTABLE']]) # Sit on a suitable object\nSTANDUP: (0, []) # Stand up from a sitting or lying position\nSWITCHOFF: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Turn off an item with a switch\nSWITCHON: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Turn on an item with a switch\nTOUCH: (1, [[]]) # Physically touch something\nTURNTO: (1, [[]]) # Turn your body to face something\nWATCH: (1, [[]]) # Observe something attentively\nWIPE: (1, [[]]) # Clean or dry something by rubbing\nPUTON: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Dress oneself with an item of clothing\nPUTOFF: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Remove an item of clothing\nGREET: (1, [['PERSON']]) # Offer a greeting to a person\nDROP: (1, [[]]) # Let go of something so it falls\nREAD: (1, [['READABLE']]) # Read text from an object\nLIE: (1, [['LIEABLE']]) # Lay oneself down on an object\nPOUR: (2, [['POURABLE', 'DRINKABLE'], ['RECIPIENT']]) # Transfer a liquid from one container to another\nPUSH: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Exert force on something to move it away from you\nPULL: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Exert force on something to bring it towards you\nMOVE: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Change the location of an object\nWASH: (1, [[]]) # Clean something by immersing and agitating it in water\nRINSE: (1, [[]]) # Remove soap from something by applying water\nSCRUB: (1, [[]]) # Clean something by rubbing it hard with a brush\nSQUEEZE: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Compress clothes to extract liquid\nPLUGIN: (1, [['HAS_PLUG']]) # Connect an electrical device to a power source\nPLUGOUT: (1, [['HAS_PLUG']]) # Disconnect an electrical device from a power source\nCUT: (1, [['EATABLE', 'CUTABLE']]) # Cut some food\nEAT: (1, [['EATABLE']]) # Eat some food\nRELEASE: (1, [[]]) # Let go of something inside the current room\nTYPE: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Type on a keyboard\n\nNotice: \n1.

Besides, GRAB should be executed earlier than TYPE or TOUCH, and TYPE or TOUCH should be executed earlier than OPEN.\nIf the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nThere is no action requirement.\nIt means there is no action you have to include in output, and you can use any action to achieve the node and edge goals. Warning: No action requirement does not mean empty output. You should always output some actions and their arguments.\n\n\nAction commands include action name and objects. The number of objects (required_number of parameters) for each action is fixed and is given below, either 0, 1, or 2. The output action commands should be in json format. The dictionary keys should be action names. The dictionary values should be a list containing the objects of the corresponding action, where [] is for 0 object, [object] is for 1 object, [object 1, object 2] is for 2 objects. The action commands order is represented by the order they appear in the json dictionary. The key value pair appearing first will be executed first, the key value pair appearing second will be executed second, so on and so forth.\n\nFor example, if you want to first FIND the sink and then PUTBACK cup to the sink, you should express it as {'FIND':['sink'], 'PUTBACK':['cup', 'sink']}\n\nThe object of action also needs to satisfied some properties preconditions. For example, SWITCHON's object number is 1. To switch on something, the object should 'HAS_SWITCH'. The rule is represented as SWITCHON = (\"Switch on\", 1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]). Another example is POUR. POUR's object number is 2. To pour sth A into sth B, A should be pourable and drinkable, and B should be RECIPIENT.

It follows the format: <object_name> (object_id)\n\nNodes and edges in the current environment shows the nodes' names, states and properties, and edges in the environment. \nNodes follow the format: object_name, states:... , properties:...\nEdges follow the format: object_name A is ... to object_name B\n \nNode goals show the target object states in the ending environment. They follow the format: object_name is ... (some state)\n\nEdge goals show the target relationships of objects in the ending environment. They follow the format: object_name A is ... (some relationship) to object_name B.\n\nAction goals specify the necessary actions you need to include in your predicted action commands sequence, and the order they appear in action goals should also be the RELATIVE order they appear in your predicted action commands sequence if there are more than one line. Each line in action goals include one action or more than one actions concatenated by OR. You only need to include ONE of the actions concatenated by OR in the same line. For example, if the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nGRAB\nTYPE or TOUCH\nOPEN\n------------------------\nThen your predicted action commands sequence should include GRAB, either TYPE or TOUCH, and OPEN. Besides, GRAB should be executed earlier than TYPE or TOUCH, and TYPE or TOUCH should be executed earlier than OPEN.\nIf the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nThere is no action requirement.\nIt means there is no action you have to include in output, and you can use any action to achieve the node and edge goals. Warning: No action requirement does not mean empty output. You should always output some actions and their arguments.\n\n\nAction commands include action name and objects. The number of objects (required_number of parameters) for each action is fixed and is given below, either 0, 1, or 2. The output action commands should be in json format. The dictionary keys should be action names. The dictionary values should be a list containing the objects of the corresponding action, where [] is for 0 object, [object] is for 1 object, [object 1, object 2] is for 2 objects. The action commands order is represented by the order they appear in the json dictionary. The key value pair appearing first will be executed first, the key value pair appearing second will be executed second, so on and so forth.\n\nFor example, if you want to first FIND the sink and then PUTBACK cup to the sink, you should express it as {'FIND':['sink'], 'PUTBACK':['cup', 'sink']}\n\nThe object of action also needs to satisfied some properties preconditions. For example, SWITCHON's object number is 1. To switch on something, the object should 'HAS_SWITCH'. The rule is represented as SWITCHON = (\"Switch on\", 1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]). Another example is POUR. POUR's object number is 2. To pour sth A into sth B, A should be pourable and drinkable, and B should be RECIPIENT. The rule is represented as POUR = (\"Pour\", 2, [['POURABLE', 'DRINKABLE'], ['RECIPIENT']]).\n\nAction Definitions Format:\nEach action is defined as a combination of:\nAction Name (String): A descriptive name for the action.\nRequired Number of Parameters (Integer): The count of parameters needed to perform the action.\nPreconditions for Each Object (List of Lists of Strings): Conditions that must be met for each object involved in the action.\n\nSupported Actions List:\nCLOSE: (1, [['CAN_OPEN']]) # Change state from OPEN to CLOSED\nDRINK: (1, [['DRINKABLE', 'RECIPIENT']]) # Consume a drinkable item\nFIND: (1, [[]]) # Locate and approach an item\nWALK: (1, [[]]) # Move towards something\nGRAB: (1, [['GRABBABLE']]) # Take hold of an item that can be grabbed\nLOOKAT: (1, [[]]) # Direct your gaze towards something\nOPEN: (1, [['CAN_OPEN']]) # Open an item that can be opened\nPOINTAT: (1, [[]]) # Point towards something\nPUTBACK: (2, [['GRABBABLE'], []]) # Place one object back onto or into another\nPUTIN: (2, [['GRABBABLE'], ['CAN_OPEN']]) # Insert one object into another\nRUN: (1, [[]]) # Run towards something\nSIT: (1, [['SITTABLE']]) # Sit on a suitable object\nSTANDUP: (0, []) # Stand up from a sitting or lying position\nSWITCHOFF: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Turn off an item with a switch\nSWITCHON: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Turn on an item with a switch\nTOUCH: (1, [[]]) # Physically touch something\nTURNTO: (1, [[]]) # Turn your body to face something\nWATCH: (1, [[]]) # Observe something attentively\nWIPE: (1, [[]]) # Clean or dry something by rubbing\nPUTON: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Dress oneself with an item of clothing\nPUTOFF: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Remove an item of clothing\nGREET: (1, [['PERSON']]) # Offer a greeting to a person\nDROP: (1, [[]]) # Let go of something so it falls\nREAD: (1, [['READABLE']]) # Read text from an object\nLIE: (1, [['LIEABLE']]) # Lay oneself down on an object\nPOUR: (2, [['POURABLE', 'DRINKABLE'], ['RECIPIENT']]) # Transfer a liquid from one container to another\nPUSH: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Exert force on something to move it away from you\nPULL: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Exert force on something to bring it towards you\nMOVE: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Change the location of an object\nWASH: (1, [[]]) # Clean something by immersing and agitating it in water\nRINSE: (1, [[]]) # Remove soap from something by applying water\nSCRUB: (1, [[]]) # Clean something by rubbing it hard with a brush\nSQUEEZE: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Compress clothes to extract liquid\nPLUGIN: (1, [['HAS_PLUG']]) # Connect an electrical device to a power source\nPLUGOUT: (1, [['HAS_PLUG']]) # Disconnect an electrical device from a power source\nCUT: (1, [['EATABLE', 'CUTABLE']]) # Cut some food\nEAT: (1, [['EATABLE']]) # Eat some food\nRELEASE: (1, [[]]) # Let go of something inside the current room\nTYPE: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Type on a keyboard\n\nNotice: \n1.

It follows the format: <object_name> (object_id)\n\nNodes and edges in the current environment shows the nodes' names, states and properties, and edges in the environment. \nNodes follow the format: object_name, states:... , properties:...\nEdges follow the format: object_name A is ... to object_name B\n \nNode goals show the target object states in the ending environment. They follow the format: object_name is ... (some state)\n\nEdge goals show the target relationships of objects in the ending environment. They follow the format: object_name A is ... (some relationship) to object_name B.\n\nAction goals specify the necessary actions you need to include in your predicted action commands sequence, and the order they appear in action goals should also be the RELATIVE order they appear in your predicted action commands sequence if there are more than one line. Each line in action goals include one action or more than one actions concatenated by OR. You only need to include ONE of the actions concatenated by OR in the same line. For example, if the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nGRAB\nTYPE or TOUCH\nOPEN\n------------------------\nThen your predicted action commands sequence should include GRAB, either TYPE or TOUCH, and OPEN. Besides, GRAB should be executed earlier than TYPE or TOUCH, and TYPE or TOUCH should be executed earlier than OPEN.\nIf the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nThere is no action requirement.\nIt means there is no action you have to include in output, and you can use any action to achieve the node and edge goals. Warning: No action requirement does not mean empty output. You should always output some actions and their arguments.\n\n\nAction commands include action name and objects. The number of objects (required_number of parameters) for each action is fixed and is given below, either 0, 1, or 2. The output action commands should be in json format. The dictionary keys should be action names. The dictionary values should be a list containing the objects of the corresponding action, where [] is for 0 object, [object] is for 1 object, [object 1, object 2] is for 2 objects. The action commands order is represented by the order they appear in the json dictionary. The key value pair appearing first will be executed first, the key value pair appearing second will be executed second, so on and so forth.\n\nFor example, if you want to first FIND the sink and then PUTBACK cup to the sink, you should express it as {'FIND':['sink'], 'PUTBACK':['cup', 'sink']}\n\nThe object of action also needs to satisfied some properties preconditions. For example, SWITCHON's object number is 1. To switch on something, the object should 'HAS_SWITCH'. The rule is represented as SWITCHON = (\"Switch on\", 1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]). Another example is POUR. POUR's object number is 2. To pour sth A into sth B, A should be pourable and drinkable, and B should be RECIPIENT.

Each line in action goals include one action or more than one actions concatenated by OR. You only need to include ONE of the actions concatenated by OR in the same line. For example, if the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nGRAB\nTYPE or TOUCH\nOPEN\n------------------------\nThen your predicted action commands sequence should include GRAB, either TYPE or TOUCH, and OPEN. Besides, GRAB should be executed earlier than TYPE or TOUCH, and TYPE or TOUCH should be executed earlier than OPEN.\nIf the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nThere is no action requirement.\nIt means there is no action you have to include in output, and you can use any action to achieve the node and edge goals.

The action commands order is represented by the order they appear in the json dictionary.

For example, SWITCHON's object number is 1. To switch on something, the object should 'HAS_SWITCH'. The rule is represented as SWITCHON = (\"Switch on\", 1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]). Another example is POUR. POUR's object number is 2. To pour sth A into sth B, A should be pourable and drinkable, and B should be RECIPIENT.

The input will be the related objects in the scene, nodes and edges in the current environment, and the desired node goals, edge goals, and action goals. The output should be action commands in json format so that after the robot executes the action commands sequentially, the ending environment would satisfy the goals. \n\nData format:\nObjects in the scene indicates those objects involved in the action execution. It follows the format: <object_name> (object_id)\n\nNodes and edges in the current environment shows the nodes' names, states and properties, and edges in the environment. \nNodes follow the format: object_name, states:... , properties:...\nEdges follow the format: object_name A is ... to object_name B\n \nNode goals show the target object states in the ending environment. They follow the format: object_name is ... (some state)\n\nEdge goals show the target relationships of objects in the ending environment. They follow the format: object_name A is ... (some relationship) to object_name B.\n\nAction goals specify the necessary actions you need to include in your predicted action commands sequence, and the order they appear in action goals should also be the RELATIVE order they appear in your predicted action commands sequence if there are more than one line. Each line in action goals include one action or more than one actions concatenated by OR. You only need to include ONE of the actions concatenated by OR in the same line. For example, if the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nGRAB\nTYPE or TOUCH\nOPEN\n------------------------\nThen your predicted action commands sequence should include GRAB, either TYPE or TOUCH, and OPEN. Besides, GRAB should be executed earlier than TYPE or TOUCH, and TYPE or TOUCH should be executed earlier than OPEN.\nIf the action goal is:\nThe following action(s) should be included:\nThere is no action requirement.\nIt means there is no action you have to include in output, and you can use any action to achieve the node and edge goals. Warning: No action requirement does not mean empty output. You should always output some actions and their arguments.\n\n\nAction commands include action name and objects. The number of objects (required_number of parameters) for each action is fixed and is given below, either 0, 1, or 2. The output action commands should be in json format. The dictionary keys should be action names. The dictionary values should be a list containing the objects of the corresponding action, where [] is for 0 object, [object] is for 1 object, [object 1, object 2] is for 2 objects. The action commands order is represented by the order they appear in the json dictionary. The key value pair appearing first will be executed first, the key value pair appearing second will be executed second, so on and so forth.\n\nFor example, if you want to first FIND the sink and then PUTBACK cup to the sink, you should express it as {'FIND':['sink'], 'PUTBACK':['cup', 'sink']}\n\nThe object of action also needs to satisfied some properties preconditions. For example, SWITCHON's object number is 1. To switch on something, the object should 'HAS_SWITCH'. The rule is represented as SWITCHON = (\"Switch on\", 1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]). Another example is POUR. POUR's object number is 2. To pour sth A into sth B, A should be pourable and drinkable, and B should be RECIPIENT. The rule is represented as POUR = (\"Pour\", 2, [['POURABLE', 'DRINKABLE'], ['RECIPIENT']]).\n\nAction Definitions Format:\nEach action is defined as a combination of:\nAction Name (String): A descriptive name for the action.\nRequired Number of Parameters (Integer): The count of parameters needed to perform the action.\nPreconditions for Each Object (List of Lists of Strings): Conditions that must be met for each object involved in the action.\n\nSupported Actions List:\nCLOSE: (1, [['CAN_OPEN']]) # Change state from OPEN to CLOSED\nDRINK: (1, [['DRINKABLE', 'RECIPIENT']]) # Consume a drinkable item\nFIND: (1, [[]]) # Locate and approach an item\nWALK: (1, [[]]) # Move towards something\nGRAB: (1, [['GRABBABLE']]) # Take hold of an item that can be grabbed\nLOOKAT: (1, [[]]) # Direct your gaze towards something\nOPEN: (1, [['CAN_OPEN']]) # Open an item that can be opened\nPOINTAT: (1, [[]]) # Point towards something\nPUTBACK: (2, [['GRABBABLE'], []]) # Place one object back onto or into another\nPUTIN: (2, [['GRABBABLE'], ['CAN_OPEN']]) # Insert one object into another\nRUN: (1, [[]]) # Run towards something\nSIT: (1, [['SITTABLE']]) # Sit on a suitable object\nSTANDUP: (0, []) # Stand up from a sitting or lying position\nSWITCHOFF: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Turn off an item with a switch\nSWITCHON: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Turn on an item with a switch\nTOUCH: (1, [[]]) # Physically touch something\nTURNTO: (1, [[]]) # Turn your body to face something\nWATCH: (1, [[]]) # Observe something attentively\nWIPE: (1, [[]]) # Clean or dry something by rubbing\nPUTON: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Dress oneself with an item of clothing\nPUTOFF: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Remove an item of clothing\nGREET: (1, [['PERSON']]) # Offer a greeting to a person\nDROP: (1, [[]]) # Let go of something so it falls\nREAD: (1, [['READABLE']]) # Read text from an object\nLIE: (1, [['LIEABLE']]) # Lay oneself down on an object\nPOUR: (2, [['POURABLE', 'DRINKABLE'], ['RECIPIENT']]) # Transfer a liquid from one container to another\nPUSH: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Exert force on something to move it away from you\nPULL: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Exert force on something to bring it towards you\nMOVE: (1, [['MOVABLE']]) # Change the location of an object\nWASH: (1, [[]]) # Clean something by immersing and agitating it in water\nRINSE: (1, [[]]) # Remove soap from something by applying water\nSCRUB: (1, [[]]) # Clean something by rubbing it hard with a brush\nSQUEEZE: (1, [['CLOTHES']]) # Compress clothes to extract liquid\nPLUGIN: (1, [['HAS_PLUG']]) # Connect an electrical device to a power source\nPLUGOUT: (1, [['HAS_PLUG']]) # Disconnect an electrical device from a power source\nCUT: (1, [['EATABLE', 'CUTABLE']]) # Cut some food\nEAT: (1, [['EATABLE']]) # Eat some food\nRELEASE: (1, [[]]) # Let go of something inside the current room\nTYPE: (1, [['HAS_SWITCH']]) # Type on a keyboard\n\nNotice: \n1.
